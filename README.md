# `\ionicnum` macro
A TeX macro that does a conversion from a number into Ionic numeral system (a.k.a. Greek numeral).

This works on XeLaTeX. (Modifications are needed if compile on other than XeLaTeX)


`\ionicnum` macro is defined in `ionicnum.tex`.

`\ionicnum` takes a number and outputs it along Ionic numeral system.

## Note
Since Ionic numeral system has several variants, especially writing higher than 9999, this macro may not give expected results.

See Sample section to check the results this macro gives.
